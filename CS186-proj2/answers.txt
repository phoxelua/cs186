Describe any design decisions you made, including your choice of page eviction policy. If you used something other than a nested-loops join, describe the tradeoffs of the algorithm you chose.
	BufferPool: Linked List as a queue to easily get old, new items for LRU eviction
	Aggregtors: HashMap from groupby field to SQL Aggregates (a class that holds COUNT, MIN, MAX, etc)

Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.
	None.

Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.
	None that I know of. 

Describe how long you spent on the project, and whether there was anything you found particularly difficult or confusing.
	15-20 hrs. Query Parser 2.7. Debugging this was extremely hard. I used Piazza a week early and went to 2 OH and still didn't find the reason. It was hard since the error was being thrown in the RandomAccessFile constructor- not my own methods. getFile() was not returning a null item either. Then it turned out to be in the skeleton code....
